# SemEval2024 Task 8

**Subtask A. Binary Human-Written vs. Machine-Generated Text Classification:** Given a full text, determine whether it is human-written or machine-generated.

**Subtask B. Multi-Way Machine-Generated Text Classification:** Given a full text, determine who generated it. It can be human-written or generated by a specific language model.

**Subtask C. Human-Machine Mixed Text Detection:** Given a mixed text, where the first part is human-written and the second part is machine-generated, determine the boundary, where the change occurs.

Sample data for subtasks A and B can be found here:
